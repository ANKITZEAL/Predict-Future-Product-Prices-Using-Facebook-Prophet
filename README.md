# Facebook Prophet
## Project Work


Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.



## Features

- Facebook Prophet is an open source software released by Facebook's Core data science Team.
- Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data baseg on an additive model
where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday
effects.
- Prophet works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several
seas

## Installation


Install the dependencies .

```sh
# bash
# Install pystan with pip before using pip to install prophet
# pystan>=3.0 is currently not supported
$ pip install pystan==2.19.1.1
$ pip install prophet
```

## Experimental backend - cmdstanpy
You can also choose a (more experimental) alternative stan backend called cmdstanpy. It requires the CmdStan command line interface and you will have to specify the environment variable STAN_BACKEND pointing to it, for example:
```sh
# bash
$ CMDSTAN=/tmp/cmdstan-2.22.1 STAN_BACKEND=CMDSTANPY pip install prophet
```
